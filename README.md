## Usage Example
```powershell
# Execution without parameter, list all apps

## Requirements
This function requires Windows 10 or later to access the applications through the Get-StartApps and Start-Process cmdlets.

## Easy Installation

### If you don't have, create a PowerShell profile

- Open PowerShell and type:

  ```powershell
  New-Item -Path $profile -Type File -Force
  ```

- To use the profile you will need to make sure you have set the Execution Policy to Remote Signed. Otherwise, you wonâ€™t be able to run the script when PowerShell opens. Make sure you run PowerShell with elevated permissions (admin mode) to change the execution policy:

  ```powershell
  Get-ExecutionPolicy

  # Set the ExecutionPolicy to RemoteSigned:
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```

### Add RunApp function to profile

- Go to "Documents\WindowsPowerShell", it will have a file named "Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1"
- Open with text editor and paste the function code there
